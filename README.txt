Hello, 
       I am the developer of this project. You can run this project by following these steps, and then the project will run successfully!

1 :-I used VS Code, but you can use any other platform you are comfortable with.
    Install the latest versions of the following:
    Python
    Pip
    cv2

2:- Install all the following modules:
    matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    cv2
    easyocr
    rcParams
    Image
    pytesseract 
    tkinter as tk
    messagebox
    mysql
    mysql.connector

3:- Open the zip file and get the source code. If you are reading this, it means you have already opened it.
    Now, get the .xml file and open it in VS Code, along with the source code file in Python.
    Also, create a folder to store captured number plates and add the path of the created folder in Image("D:\project\plates\scanned_img_0.jpg").
    use this image if you 1st time use this image1 MH.jpeg i provide you in zip file......

4:-Now it's time to store data in the database.
   Open the database workbench, use the root account, and enter your password (default/).
   MySQL database password: 123456789@12
   Create a new database (numberplate) and create a table to store data such as:
   number_plate
   car_location
   car_owner_name
   car_owner_mobile_no

5:-Then connect your code to the database. I have already connected it in the code, you just need to change the path of your database.
   Then run the program.

     I hope the program runs successfully, and your data is also stored successfully.

                                      *******Thank you!********
